\noindent
This quiz is \emph{open-note}, but no books or calculators may be used. In calculation, you can show work at your discretion, but remember that I can't give partial credit for calculations I can't see. Explain anything that seems to need explaining.

\begin{questions} 

\question[18] Find the critical points of the function 
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = x^3 + y^4 - 6x - 16y^2.
\end{equation*}
Use the second derivative test to determine whether each critical point is a local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.
