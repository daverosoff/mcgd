Note that the problem numbers that appear in the table are textbook numbers
(from the second edition), not WeBWorK problem numbers. Asterisks * indicate
more conceptual problems. A successful presentation of a starred problem will
involve much more *explanation* than *calculation*. Some problems depend on
other presentation problems. For example 12.3.92 relies on the result of
12.3.91. This is indicated by parenthetical remarks.
