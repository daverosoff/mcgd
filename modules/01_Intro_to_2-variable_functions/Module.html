<h2 class="title">Module 01: Intro to 2-variable functions</h2>
<h3 class="author">Dr. Dave Rosoff — Fall 2013</h3>
</div>
<p>Welcome to the first online module for Calculus 3. These modules should be read, along with any other assigned readings or videos, prior to attending class. They are carefully designed to fit in with our class discussions, workshop activities, and WeBWorK.</p>
<h3 id="our-context-mathbfr3">Our Context: <span class="math"><strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup></span></h3>
<p>This module introduces two related mathematical frameworks: the geometry of the three-dimensional Euclidean space <span class="math"><strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup></span> and functions of two variables.</p>
<p>Among others, we will explore the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>relationship between coordinates of a point and distances to coordinate planes</li>
<li>relationship between coordinates of a point and distances to other points</li>
<li>spheres, cylinders, and cones</li>
<li>contour maps and cross-sectional functions</li>
<li>modeling with linear 2-variable functions</li>
<li>intersections of surfaces</li>
<li>detect whether two vectors in <span class="math"><strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup></span> are parallel</li>
<li>displacement vectors as differences of positions</li>
<li>graphical depiction of linear relations among vectors</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="geometry-of-mathbfr3">Geometry of <span class="math"><strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup></span></h3>
<p>When we talk about the plane as being 2-dimensional, what is it that we mean? We are used to addressing, or <em>coordinatizing</em> points in the plane, as a pair of numbers. These numbers are interpreted as distances to special lines (the <em>coordinate axes</em>). The axes must be understood ahead of time, or the coordinates are meaningless. We are so used to using this notion of coordinates that most of us superimpose the axes on the plane as soon as we picture it.</p>
<p>For example, the point <span class="math">(2, 3)</span> has distance <span class="math">2</span> to the <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>-axis and distance <span class="math">3</span> to the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>-axis.</p>
