% Module 01: Intro to 2-variable functions

### Our Context: $\mathbf{R}^3$

This module introduces two related mathematical frameworks: the geometry of the three-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbf{R}^3$ and functions of two variables. 

Among others, we will explore the following topics:

* relationship between coordinates of a point and distances to coordinate planes
* relationship between coordinates of a point and distances to other points
* spheres, cylinders, and cones
* contour maps and cross-sectional functions
* modeling with linear 2-variable functions
* intersections of surfaces
* detect whether two vectors in $\mathbf{R}^3$ are parallel
* displacement vectors as differences of positions
* graphical depiction of linear relations among vectors

### Geometry of $\mathbf{R}^3$

When we talk about the plane as being 2-dimensional, what is it that we mean? We are used to addressing, or *coordinatizing* points in the plane, as a pair of numbers. These numbers are interpreted as distances to special lines (the *coordinate axes*). The axes must be understood ahead of time, or the coordinates are meaningless. We are so used to using this notion of coordinates that most of us superimpose the axes on the plane as soon as we picture it.

For example, the point $(2,3)$ has distance $2$ to the $y$-axis and distance $3$ to the $x$-axis.
