Before you can use the R Studio server, you need to initialize your account. Here are the instructions for doing so.

### Initializing R Studio 

Log in to a campus machine or your personal computer and visit the Public drive. It should be mapped to the letter P. If not, contact Dr. Rosoff. Find the folder

    P:\RStudioSetup

and visit it in Computer. Execute the file ```login``` you find there. Follow the prompts, entering the same username and password you use for email. When the windows close themselves after you read the success message, you are done.
