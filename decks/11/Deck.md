# Optimization: with and without constraints

## Warm-up

Nurl is planning to build a (rectangular prism) trophy case with five wooden sides and a glass front. He wants to make sure the dimensions of the box are 12 cubic meters. If the wood costs $\$5$ per square meter and the glass costs $\$10$ per square meter, what dimensions should Nurl use for the box?
