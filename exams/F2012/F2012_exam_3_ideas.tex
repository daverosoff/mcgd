\textbf{Instructions}: This exam is closed book. You may refer to one double-sided page of handwritten notes, but no electronic aids or other printed references are permitted. Justification of all answers is required for partial credit; please \fbox{\textbf{box}} your final answers. Unless specifically directed, leave all answers in \textbf{exact form}, e.g.\ $\sqrt{3}$ instead of~$1.732$ and~$\pi/2$ instead of~$1.57$.

Show all pertinent work. \emph{Correct answers without accompanying work will receive little or no credit.} Results from class or from homework or from class can be cited freely. It is in your interest to display your solution in a clear, readable fashion.

You need to make sure your work is organized. I suggest you start each problem on a separate page. Problems that stop and start with other problems in between are not acceptable.

%Check and make sure you have all of the pages in the
%exam; there should be \numpages, including this one. If you have a
%question, please raise your hand.

Be sure to read all questions carefully and completely.

\begin{questions}
\question In this problem, let $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 + y^3$ and let $c(t) = \langle 2+t, -3+t/3 \rangle$.

\begin{parts}
\part Find the gradient of $f$ at the point $c(0)$.

\part A bug is sitting on the graph of $f(x,y)$, directly over the point $c(0)$. In which direction should the bug face if it wants to climb up the surface most quickly? Give your answer as a 2-dimensional vector that points in the appropriate direction (it doesn't have to be a unit vector). 

\part Find the (instantaneous) rate of change of $f(x,y)$ at $c(0)$ in the $y$-direction.

\part Find the directional derivative of $f(x,y)$ at $c(0)$ in the direction given by the vector $\langle 1, 1 \rangle$. 

\part Find the (instantaneous) rate of change of $f(c(t))$ at $t = 0$. It is possible to do this using the earlier parts of this problem.
\end{parts}

\question In this problem, consider the function $g(x,y) = 7 - 2xy^2$ and the point $P = (1,-1)$. 

\begin{parts}
\part Give a formula for the linearization $L(x,y)$ of $g$ at $P$. Describe the graph of $L$ geometrically (in a complete sentence).

\part Use the linearization to estimate $g(0.9, -1.1)$.
\end{parts}
