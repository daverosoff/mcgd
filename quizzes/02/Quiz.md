This quiz is \emph{open-note}, but no books or calculators may be used. On this quiz, you must justify your answers where indicated. A word on the notation: I prefer arrows to bold for denoting vectors. The meaning is identical.

\question[4] Let $\vec{v} = \overrightarrow{PQ}$, where $P = (-4,-4)$ and $Q = (-1,-8)$. Which of the vectors with the following given tails and heads are equivalent to $\vec{v}$?

\begin{choices}
    \choice $(4, 4)$, $(1, 0)$
    \choice $(0,0)$, $(3, -4)$
    \choice $(-1,0)$, $(2,-4)$
    \choice $(4, -3)$, $(5, -7)$
\end{choices}

\question[4] Let $A = (-5, 5)$, $B = (-2, 6)$, $P = (0,1)$, and $Q = (12,5)$. Are $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ parallel, and if so, do they point in the same direction? Justify your answers.

\question[4] Let $\vec{v} = \langle 5, 9 \rangle$. Find a unit vector that points in the same direction as $\vec{v}$ (our textbook calls such a vector $\mathbf{e}_{\vec{v}}$). You can leave your answer unsimplified (no need to evaluate cumbersome square roots, etc.).
