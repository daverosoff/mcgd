Here is the blank file for Module 2. Topics:

* contour maps and cross-sectional functions
* spheres, cylinders, and cones
* intersections of some common surfaces
* detect whether two vectors in $\mathbf{R}^3$ are parallel
* displacement vectors as differences of positions
* graphical depiction of linear relations among vectors
