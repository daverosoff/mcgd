# Displacements in the plane

## What is "change in position"?

- If I move from $(2,3)$ to $(-3, 1)$, what is the most natural way to express this change?

- In everyday English, we separate it into two changes: a change in the east--west direction, and a change in the north--south direction.

## Two changes in one

"Five blocks south and two blocks west" is a pretty natural way to express the move from $(2,3)$ to $(-3, 1)$.

- Notice: it's not a sensible *address* in any city or town. Why not?
- It is a *displacement*, not a *location*.
- These are different notions!

## Universality of displacement

- If the town is laid out on a square grid (as opposed to rectangles, some other kind of parallelograms, or worse) ...
- ... walking from $(2,3)$ to $(-3, 1)$ feels the same as walking from  $(2013,2013)$ to $(2008,2010)$.

## Displacement vectors

We call this displacement the *vector* $\langle -5, -2 \rangle$. Observe the following na&iuml;ve "equations":

$$ (2,3) + \langle -5, -2 \rangle = (-3, 1) $$
$$ (2013,2013) + \langle -5, -2 \rangle = (2008,2010) $$

> Visualize the vector as an arrow: its head is 5 blocks west and 2 blocks south of its tail.

## Adding vectors to points?

- Seems a little dodgy... usually, we add like to like. 
- Eventually, you'll ignore the distinction...
- ...but for now, vectors and points are different things.

## Different, but related

> Displacement vector corresponds to a point:

- Given a vector, say $\langle x_0, y_0 \rangle$, place its tail at $(0,0)$. 
- Then its head is located at the *point* $(x_0, y_0)$.
- This is called the vector's *standard position*. 

## Vector arithmetic

It's easy to add and subtract vectors: do it entry by entry.

$$ \langle x_0, y_0 \rangle \pm \langle x_1, y_1 \rangle = \langle x_0 \pm x_1, y_0 + y_1 \rangle. $$

Multiply a vector by a number:

$$ c \langle x_0, y_0 \rangle = \langle cx_0, cy_0 \rangle. $$
