Before presentation of d07 (about tangent lines to slice curves and linearization, local linearity, tangent planes), we did a very good warm-up to remind people what's going on:

Find the tangent line to the graph of x^3 + x + 1 at (1,3)
and find the plane normal to <-54, -10, 1> at (3, 1, 14)

The plane is the normal to z = -9x^2 - 5y^2 + 100 at (3, 1, 86).

This reminds people of the functioning of the point-slope formula in time to understand the linearization equation for functions of two variables.

d07 and m08 are the same content.
