% Dr. Dave Rosoff
% Fall 2013

Welcome to Module 2. You should have been able to make some progress on WeBWorK assignment 1. In this module, we'll discuss the remaining topics you'll need to understand to complete it.

* contour maps and cross-sectional functions
* spheres, cylinders, and cones
* intersections of some common surfaces
* detect whether two vectors in $\mathbf{R}^3$ are parallel
* displacement vectors as differences of positions
* graphical depiction of linear relations among vectors
