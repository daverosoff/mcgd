\noindent
This quiz is \emph{open-note}, but no books or calculators may be used. In calculation, you can show work at your discretion, but remember that I can't give partial credit for calculations I can't see. Explain anything that seems to need explaining.

\begin{questions} 

\question[4] Suppose that the plane tangent to the surface $z = f(x,y)$ at $(6, 4, 20)$ has equation $z - 3x + 2y = 10$. Estimate $f(5.9, 4.2)$. Do not simplify your answer.
