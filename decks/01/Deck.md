# Squares of distances

## Distances in the plane

- Find the distance between $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ in the plane:

$$ d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \sqrt{(y_2 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - x_1)^2} $$

Works because $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ are the endpoints of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. 

## Cleaning up the square root

- Often better to work with squares of distances

- This is because there are no square roots involved

$$ d^2 = (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - x_1)^2 $$

- Because two positive numbers are equal if and only if their squares are equal. 


# Distance from a point to an axis

## Coordinate planes and axes

- Planes $x = 0$, $y = 0$, $z = 0$ are called the *coordinate* planes: the $(y,z)$-plane, $(x,z)$-plane, and $(x,y)$-plane, respectively

- Intersect any pair of coordinate planes, we get a line. 

Intersection of the $(x,z)$-plane with the $(y,z)$-plane is a line whose points evidently all satisfy $y = x = 0$. This line is called the $z$-axis.
