* Begin with ww01.09 and the graphs. 
* Boards for some WW problems -- discuss how graphs work
* Exercises from m02 about cylinders and cones
* 20-minute deck 02 about vectors.

-------------------

We didn't get to vectors. Good discussion about conics
and good board work graphing cones.

Rescheduled, so tomorrow is linear functions and vectors.

Design w01 to slice graphs for tomorrow. Slides are ready to go (d02).
