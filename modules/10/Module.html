<p>Note to the reader: in this module, I have adopted a new and experimental convention for angles in radian measure. Namely, we let <span class="math">\(\tau = 2\pi\)</span> and express most angles as multiples of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> rather than <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>. Thus, for example, a right angle is <span class="math">\(\tau/4\)</span>. Think of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> as “one turn” (it’s Greek “t”, after all) and you’re good.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-coordinates"><a href="#what-are-coordinates">What are coordinates?</a></h3>
<p>Many people are surprised to learn that coordinates are a relatively recent mathematical innovation, even though we associate them with the name of Descartes (1596–1650 CE). Their use was unknown, for example, to Archimedes (287–212 BCE), though he was able to establish the familiar formula <span class="math">\(V = 2\tau r^3/3\)</span> for the volume of a sphere in terms of its radius. Archimedes did this and much more using techniques that prefigure calculus but anticipate it by more than 18 centuries, and altogether without the aid of algebra or coordinate geometry (only the “synthetic” geometry of Euclid).</p>
<p>We moderns, however, are so thoroughly trained in the use of cartesian<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> coordinates that it is difficult to imagine a plane without imagining it being pocked with an origin, ruled with axes and gridlines. But there is nothing <em>canonical</em>, nothing <em>god-given</em>, about this way of using numbers to locate or index points in the geometric plane. We can use the familiar cartesian system to construct new coordinate systems, on oblong or curved “grids”.</p>
<p>You will have noticed that I postponed our discussion of this topic to after half the semester has passed, when if we followed Rogawski’s Table of Contents we would have discussed polar coordinates in Week 2. This is because I think they are very well motivated by questions that arise in the study of double integrals.</p>
<p>Do we really have to limit ourselves to slicing parallel to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axes? It’s very unnatural for circular regions, say. The expressions you found (in <a href="../../workshops/09/Workshop.pdf">Workshop 09</a>) for the limits are unpleasant.</p>
<p>What if we could slice in a circular way, and then total up all the circular contributions? This might simplify our calculations a great deal.</p>
<p>Clever choices of coordinates are no stranger to students of physics. It shouldn’t be surprising that choosing an appropriate coordinate <em>system</em> can also make your life better. Many physical situations have a rotational symmetry that makes polar coordinates particularly appealing. Nature is full of circles, but lines are usually made by humans.</p>
<p>There are many, many other systems of coordinates (see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Coordinate_systems">this listing from Wikipedia</a>), but in the plane, only the polar system concerns us here.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-polar-coordinates"><a href="#the-idea-of-polar-coordinates">The idea of polar coordinates</a></h3>
<p>In ordinary cartesian coordinates, we label points with a pair of signed distances: the signed distances to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axes become the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-coordinates (respectively; make sure you have read this sentence carefully). The curves <span class="math">\(x = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = b\)</span> for various <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> form the cartesian grid. Polar coordinates are easier to understand if you make an analogy between them and the familiar setup.</p>
<p>In fact, I think you should regard these curves—the <em>coordinate curves</em>—as fundamental. The point <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> is properly regarded as “the unique point lying in the intersection of the coordinate curves <span class="math">\(x = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = b\)</span>” rather than the grade-school formulation “start at the origin and move <span class="math">\(a\)</span> units in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction,…”.</p>
<p>We begin with a plane that includes the origin, the unit circle, and the positive <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis. Instead of labeling a point <span class="math">\(P\)</span> relative to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axes, we label it by its <em>radial coordinate</em> or <em>radius</em> <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. This is the (unsigned) distance from <span class="math">\(P\)</span> to the origin. Already we have some coordinate curves analogous to the cartesian gridlines: for <span class="math">\(r_0 \geq 0\)</span>, the curve <span class="math">\(r = r_0\)</span> is a circle centered at the origin of radius <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>. Each point in the plane lies on exactly one such circle.</p>
<p>The second coordinate is not a distance, but an angle: the <em>angular coordinate</em> or <em>azimuth</em> <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>. It is defined in the following way: draw the ray from the origin to <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, and the positive <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis. The azimuth of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is the angle formed by these rays in the counterclockwise direction. Thus we may always choose <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> to lie in the interval <span class="math">\([0, \tau)\)</span>. If we do so, then points in the upper half-plane have <span class="math">\(0 &lt; \theta &lt; \tau/2\)</span>, while points in the lower half-plane have <span class="math">\(\tau/2 &lt; \theta &lt; \tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>The coordinate curves <span class="math">\(\theta = \theta_0\)</span> are <em>rays</em> emanating from the origin: <span class="math">\(\theta = 0\)</span> is the positive <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis, <span class="math">\(\theta = \tau/8\)</span> is the part of the line <span class="math">\(y = x\)</span> lying in the first quadrant, and so on.</p>
<h4 id="indeterminacy-of-azimuth"><a href="#indeterminacy-of-azimuth">Indeterminacy of azimuth</a></h4>
<p>Of course, the radian measure of an angle is not unique. We may add any integer multiple of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> without changing the angle. This has a perhaps unfortunate consequence: points in the polar coordinate system have more than one coordinate address.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \cdots = (2, -11\tau/6) = (2, -5\tau/6) = (2, \tau/6) = (2, 7\tau/6) = (2, 13\tau/6) =  \cdots \]</span></p>
<p>We are so accustomed to this <em>indeterminacy</em> that it seems OK to let it into our new coordinate world. Thus each point of the plane, with one exception, has infinitely many coordinate representations, one for each multiple of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>The exception is the origin, for which <span class="math">\(r = 0\)</span>. Any angle at all will do for a polar representation of this point, which causes some difficulty later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this means the definition of <em>equality</em> is different from before. In the cartesian world, two points <span class="math">\(P = (x_0,y_0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q = (x_1,y_1)\)</span> are equal exactly when their coordinates are equal: when <span class="math">\(x_0 = x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y_0 = y_1\)</span>. But because of the indeterminacy of azimuth, we can have <span class="math">\(\theta_0 \ne \theta_1\)</span>, yet <span class="math">\((r_0, \theta_0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((r_0, \theta_1)\)</span> are the same point.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="negative-radial-coordinate"><a href="#negative-radial-coordinate">Negative radial coordinate</a></h4>
<p>Since we are unable to avoid indeterminacy of azimuth, we may as well not restrict the radius to be nonnegative either. We can make coherent sense of negative radial coordinates in a very “vectorish” way, by declaring <span class="math">\((-r_0, \theta_0) = (r_0, \theta_0 + \tau/2)\)</span>: go the same distance <span class="math">\(\lvert r_0 \rvert\)</span> along the opposite ray <span class="math">\(\theta = \theta_0 + \tau/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that with this convention it is possible that <span class="math">\(r_0 \ne r_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\theta_0 \ne \theta_1\)</span>, yet <span class="math">\((r_0, \theta_0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((r_1, \theta_1)\)</span> are the same point.</p>
<h4 id="the-polar-phase-space"><a href="#the-polar-phase-space">The polar phase space</a></h4>
<p>If we draw a new <em>cartesian</em> plane, with axes labeled <span class="math">\(r\)</span> for the horizontal and <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> for the vertical, we may plot the region <span class="math">\(\{ (r, \theta) : r \geq 0, 0 \leq \theta &lt; \tau \}\)</span>. It is a strip of height <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>, extending infinitely to the right, whose upper edge is deleted. This strip is called a fundamental region for the polar coordinate system; I also call it a phase space. You might think of the polar coordinate system as a mapping or transformation between this region and the whole plane.</p>
<p>The mapping referred to above takes the vertical segments in phase space (the segments <span class="math">\(r = r_0\)</span>) to the coordinate circles <span class="math">\(r = r_0\)</span> in polar coordinates. It takes the horizontal rays <span class="math">\(\theta = \theta_0\)</span> in phase space to the coordinate rays <span class="math">\(\theta = \theta_0\)</span> in polar coordinates.</p>
<p>We’ll have more to say about this later.</p>
<h3 id="interlude-polar-coordinates-and-double-integrals"><a href="#interlude-polar-coordinates-and-double-integrals">Interlude: polar coordinates and double integrals</a></h3>
<p>You can already see the utility of these ideas. What we would like to be able to do is transform the whole idea of the double integral into these new coordinates, so that instead of integrating over an area element <span class="math">\(dA = dx \; dy\)</span> or <span class="math">\(dy \; dx\)</span>, we can use one related<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> to <span class="math">\(dr \; d\theta\)</span>. Then suitable limits of integration for the unit disk might be <span class="math">\(r = 0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(r = 1\)</span> (the contribution of a typical ray from the origin to the edge of the disk) and <span class="math">\(\theta = 0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\theta = \tau\)</span> (totaling up the contributions of all such rays).</p>
<p>No variables in the limits? This is a real improvement over the technology of <a href="../../workshops/09/Workshop.pdf">Worksheet 09</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-polar-coordinate-transformation"><a href="#the-polar-coordinate-transformation">The polar coordinate transformation</a></h3>
<p>If you know a point’s polar coordinates, it is easy to get its cartesian coordinates, via the following formulas:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ x = r \cos{\theta}, \quad y = r \sin{\theta} \]</span></p>
<p>These equations together are called the <em>polar coordinate transformation</em>. Notice how they are arranged: with <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> alone on the left-hand sides. Use them when you have <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and you want <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>To go the other way is uglier. It is pretty easy to find <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the distance from your point <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> to the origin. Let’s write it this way, and keep the possibility that <span class="math">\(r &lt; 0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \]</span></p>
<p>The angle formula is written <span class="math">\(\tan{\theta} = y/x\)</span>. <strong>Resist the urge to rewrite this using the arctangent function.</strong> In practice we do use the arctangent to find <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>, but if <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is in the second or third quadrants, arctangent will give us the partner angle instead.</p>
<h3 id="functions-in-polar-coordinates"><a href="#functions-in-polar-coordinates">Functions in polar coordinates</a></h3>
<p>Most of the time, it makes more sense to think of <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> as the independent variable and write <span class="math">\(r = f(\theta)\)</span>. We have seen that constant functions are circles centered at the origin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example.</em> What is the shape of the function <span class="math">\(r = a \cos\theta\)</span>? If we have the bright idea to multiply both sides by <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, we find <span class="math">\[ r^2 = a r \cos\theta, \]</span> which according to the polar coordinate transformation has the cartesian representation <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 = ax\)</span>. Completing the square in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> then yields <span class="math">\(x^2 - ax + (a^2/4) + y^2 = a^2/4\)</span>, or equivalently <span class="math">\[ (x - a/2)^2 + y^2 = (a/2)^2. \]</span> Evidently, <span class="math">\(r = a \cos\theta\)</span> is a circle of radius <span class="math">\(a/2\)</span> centered at <span class="math">\((a/2, 0)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general most polar functions are not recognizable, and those that are require clever tricks like in the example. I encourage you to play with the graphing calculator utility <a href="http://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a>, which understands that equations involving <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> are to be plotted in the polar sense.</p>
