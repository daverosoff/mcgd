# Workshop 09: Integration over planar regions

You saw in [the presentation][d13] how to decompose double integrals over a triangle into iterated integrals. The same technique works for regions whose boundaries have nice algebraic expressions. We will only concern ourselves with regions whose boundaries are made up of line segments, arcs of circles, and pieces of the graphs of functions. Our regions will also all be "connected"---that is, they are all one piece.

## More triangles

The simplest regions meeting our descriptions other than rectangles are triangles: specifically triangles with one side parallel to an axis. Give your answers by writing an integral of an anonymous function $f(x,y)$---that is, fill in the limits and the differentials, but don't pick a function to integrate.

\begin{questions}

\question For each triangle, find the limits of an iterated integral in each of the possible orders of integration. Draw \emph{big, beautiful pictures}.

\begin{parts}

    \part The triangle with vertices $(-1,2)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(-1, -2)$.

    \dwrspace{1}

    \part The triangle with vertices $(-1, 2)$, $(-1, -1)$, and $(1,1)$.

    \dwrspace{1}

    \newpage

    \part The triangle with verticles $(-1, -1)$, $(3, -1)$, and $(0,2)$.

\subsection{Regions with curved boundaries}

\question Let $R$ be the region whose boundary is the lines $y = 0$ and $x = 2$ and the parabola $x = y^2$. Find limits for iterated integrals over $R$ in both orders.

\newpage

\question Let $U$ and $L$ be the parts of the unit disk that fall in the upper and lower half-planes, respectively. Find limits for iterated integrals over $U$ and $L$, in both orders.

\dwrspace{1}

\question Let $\mathbf{D}$ be the unit disk. Find limits for iterated integrals over $\mathbf{D}$ in both orders.

\dwrspace{1}

\subsection{When order matters}

\question Let $C$ be the circular cap consisting of those points of $\mathbf{D}$ whose $x$-coordinates are at least $-1/2$. Draw $C$, and try to find limits for an iterated integral over it in one or the other order. Are  they equivalent?

\newpage

\question Let $S$ be the parabolic sector whose boundary is the parabola $y = x^2$ and the line $y = x + 2$. 

\begin{parts}

    \part Find limits for an iterated integral over $S$ in the order $dy \; dx$.

    \dwrspace{1}

    \part Find limits for an iterated integral over $S$ in the order $dx \; dy$.
