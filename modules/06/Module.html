<h3 id="classifying-planes-with-cross-products"><a href="#classifying-planes-with-cross-products">Classifying planes with cross products</a></h3>
<p>As you prepare to read section 12.5 on the classification of planes, the discussion here may provide some useful context.</p>
<h3 id="dimension-and-direction"><a href="#dimension-and-direction">Dimension and direction</a></h3>
<p>What is it that we mean when we say a space is <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional?</p>
<p>Usually, we mean that it is possible to give addresses of points in the space using <span class="math">\(n\)</span> coordinates—that is to say, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> numbers. Cartesian coordinates in <span class="math">\(\R^1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\R^2\)</span> are one example, but so are latitude and longitude on the globe of the earth.</p>
<p>Since each point on the earth is uniquely<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> addressable with these two coordinates, we say the Earth’s surface is <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-dimensional. It is embedded in the larger <span class="math">\(3\)</span>-dimensional space of the cosmos, but that does not affect the surface’s intrinsic dimension.</p>
<p>Let us now confine our discussion to the Euclidean space <span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span>. Imagine a vector <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> in standard position. There is a unique line containing this vector (the line through the origin and the vector’s head).</p>
<p>This line is a <span class="math">\(1\)</span>-dimensional space, but our choice of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> endows it with new structure: effectively, we can make this space into a new <em>axis</em>. What I mean is that we can coordinatize the line containing <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> by using the length and direction of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> to measure distances along it.</p>
<p>For example, the origin receives the coordinate <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. The head of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> itself (in standard position) receives the coordinate <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. A point twice as far from the origin as <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> receives the coordinate <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. Points measured along our line in the direction opposite to <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> receive negative coordinates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We thus express each point on the line as a multiple of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> in a unique way, as <span class="math">\(a_1 \vv_1\)</span> for some real number <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span>. The points on the line correspond exactly to the real numbers <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you understand that <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> is not measuring distance from the origin in the usual way, but with a yardstick of length <span class="math">\(\lVert \vv_1 \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that most points in <span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span> cannot be addressed in this way, because they do not lie on the line spanned by <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="general-2-dimensional-coordinates"><a href="#general-2-dimensional-coordinates">General 2-dimensional coordinates</a></h3>
<p>Now let us add a second vector <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span>, not a multiple of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span>. This condition ensures that, in standard position, there is a <em>unique</em> plane containing both <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span>. (If <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span> were a multiple of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span>, there would be many planes containing both, not just one.) Our choice of these two vectors coordinatizes the plane containing them.</p>
<p>Even if <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span> are not perpendicular, or have different lengths, they still “address” every point in the plane they span. This means that each point in the plane they span is reachable by traveling some (possibly negative) distance in the <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span>-direction and then traveling again in the <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span>-direction. The canonical example of this is the <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span>-plane itself with the usual coordinates, coordinatized by the standard unit vectors</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \hat{\imath} = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle, \quad \hat{\jmath} = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle. \]</span></p>
<p>It is possible, and perhaps not hard, to prove that such an address is unique. We omit the proof here and assume the result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We thus express each point on the plane containing <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span> in a unique way, as a linear combination <span class="math">\(a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \vv_2\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span> may be any real numbers. The points on the plane correspond exactly to the pairs <span class="math">\((a_1, a_2)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, we are using the <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> to measure distance in units of <span class="math">\(\lVert \vv_i \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<p>Returning to the general situation of <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span>, it is still clear that most points of <span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span> are not addressable by a pair as above, because they do not lie on the plane spanned by <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="the-complementary-dimension"><a href="#the-complementary-dimension">The complementary dimension</a></h3>
<p>Any third vector <span class="math">\(\vv_3\)</span> not on the plane (that is, not of the form <span class="math">\(a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \vv_2\)</span>) allows us to construct addresses for all of the points in <span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span>, a fact we do not prove here.</p>
<p>The meaning of this fact is that if <span class="math">\(\vv_3\)</span> is chosen so as not to be contained in the plane spanned by <span class="math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vv_2\)</span>, then every point in <span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span> is addressable as a linear combination</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \vv_2 + a_3 \vv_3 \]</span></p>
<p>for appropriate choices of the <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The cross product provides a natural choice of <span class="math">\(\vv_3\)</span>, namely <span class="math">\(\vv_3 = \vv_1 \times \vv_2\)</span>. This is what is meant by the “complementarity” property of the cross product, described in the initial <a href="../../decks/05/Deck.pdf">cross product presentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="normal-vectors-to-planes"><a href="#normal-vectors-to-planes">Normal vectors to planes</a></h3>
<p>We have seen that the choice of two vectors lying in a plane through the origin naturally determines a third, complementary vector, their cross product.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if we restrict our attention to planes <em>passing through the origin</em>, a vector also determines a plane, in the following way. Let <span class="math">\(\nn\)</span> be any vector, again in standard position. Let us examine the set of vectors</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \{ \vv \in \R^3: \vv \cdot \nn = 0 \}. \]</span></p>
<p>This is the set of vectors orthogonal to <span class="math">\(\nn\)</span>. A moment’s reflection will convince you that this set is a plane. That is, if the vectors orthogonal to <span class="math">\(\nn\)</span> are all placed in standard position, their heads are arranged in a geometric plane. Moreover, the entire plane is <em>normal</em> (perpendicular) to <span class="math">\(\nn\)</span>.</p>
<p>This geometric arrangement—a plane and a vector normal to it—will allow us to classify all planes in <span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span>, similarly to how the lines in <span class="math">\(\R^2\)</span> are classified by their slopes and intercepts.</p>
