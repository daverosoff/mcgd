Here is a list of equations and formulas you may want to include on your exam note sheet. It is not intended to be exhaustive.

First, you should know how to draw pictures of the following plane and solid figures, given equations describing their points.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lines
    \item Planes
    \item Parabolas (opening in any of the four plane coordinate directions)
    \item Circles
    \item Spheres and hemispheres
    \item Elliptic paraboloids opening in a coordinate direction with circular cross-section
    \item Parallelograms and triangles; parallelepipeds (skew boxes in $\R^3$)
\end{itemize}

Standard parametrizations of lines, line segments, circles, and graphs of functions $y = f(x)$ or $x = g(y)$ should also be included in your notes if not engraved on your brain.
