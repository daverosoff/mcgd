### Grading rubric for Workshop 05 

1. Make sure the vector is parallel to $\angl{1,3}$.

2. Make sure that $\vv \cdot \ww = 0$.

3. Make sure the slope is right; $-1/3$.

4. As long as the idea is $\angl{x,y} \mapsto y/x$, they're good. If they express confusion about how to write it, my preferred way would be (at this point) $f(\angl{x,y}) = y/x$.

5. They should have the correct tangent line, $y = 3x + 1$, or when rearranged, $3x - y = -1$.

6. The line's slope is $-A/B$, and since $\angl{A,B} = -B \angl{-A/B, 1}$ with $B \ne 0$, the vectors are parallel.

7. The general tangent line is $y - f(a) = f'(a)(x-a)$, or $f'(a) x - y = f'(a) a - f(a)$. 

8. A vector orthogonal to the tangent line would be $\angl{1, f'(a)}$. The dot product is evidently 0, so the claim is proved.
