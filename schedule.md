% Math 251 Schedule of Topics: Fall 2013 

Here, you can find a rough guide to what was discussed in class on any
particular day. If you missed class, you can also find workshop handouts
and other materials here. You should also find a classmate who will share
more specific notes from the days you were unable to attend.

All of this scheduling data is tentative and subject to change, especially
module numbering.
