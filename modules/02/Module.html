<p>Welcome to Module 2. After reading this Module, you should be able
to complete WeBWorK Assignment 1.</p>
<h3 id="contour-maps"><a href="#contour-maps">Contour maps</a></h3>
<p>The easiest way to visualize 2-variable functions is with <em>contour maps</em>.</p>
<p>In a contour plot, the points in the plane represent different output values coming from the various inputs. Recall the function from the <a href="../01/Module.html#modeling-with-linear-functions">shopping example</a> in <a href="../01/Module.html">Module 01</a>. Shirts are \(\$15\) and trousers are <span class="math">$20</span>. The cost of the trip (both ways) is <span class="math">$4</span>.</p>
<!-- <pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">linear &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">makeFun</span>(<span class="dv">4</span> +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">15</span> *<span class="st"> </span>x +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">20</span> *<span class="st"> </span>y ~<span class="st"> </span>x &amp;<span class="st"> </span>y)

    <span class="dt">nlevels =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>)</code></pre> -->
<p>Let's look at a plot of this function via Sage. Hit the evaluate button to
view a contour map for the shopping function described above.</p>
<div class="sage">
  <script type="text/x-sage">
x, y = var('x,y');
contour_plot(4+15*x+20*y,(x,0,10),(y,0,10),cmap="hsv",contours=50,labels=true)
  </script>
</div>
<p>The points of the plane are grouped into different colors. Each color forms a diagonal line across the plot, called a contour. The colors represent the different output values (the labels on the contours) that are possible with our function. When two points share a color, they give the same value of the function, and when two points have different colors, they give different values of the function.</p>
<p>Now for a more general function, the curves of each color won't be lines. For each fixed hue, the points that are colored with it form a curve (or several curves) in the plane, called a <em>contour</em>. Mathematicians also call them “level curves”. Here is an example of a contour plot of a nonlinear function. What do you notice about this plot that distinguishes it from the first plot?</p>
<!-- <pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">quad &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">makeFun</span>(x^<span class="dv">2</span> -<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">4</span> *<span class="st"> </span>x *<span class="st"> </span>y +<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">2</span> *<span class="st"> </span>y^<span class="dv">2</span> ~<span class="st"> </span>x &amp;<span class="st"> </span>y)

    <span class="dt">nlevels =</span> <span class="dv">20</span>)</code></pre> -->
<p>These are easily created in Sage, as you see above. When you see a Sage
cell in one of our modules, you can edit the code as well as simply 
evaluating it. This is one of the best ways to learn how to modify Sage
commands to do the things you will (eventually) want to do. Don't worry if
the commands in the cell below don't make sense. We will talk about them
in more detail soon, but for now just focus on the contour map.</p>

<div class="sage">
  <script type="text/x-sage">
x, y = var("x,y")
contour_plot(sin(pi*(x^2+y^2))/2,(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3),cmap="hsv",contours=25)
  </script>
</div>
<!-- <p>By default, this produces a full-color contour map. Use the <code>plotFun()</code> option <code>filled=FALSE</code> to generate a black and white contour map.</p> -->
<!-- Sage lacks a facility for machine-generated random functions (as far as I am 
aware), but it can plot a function the user provides quite readily. See the documentation for the ```ContourPlot``` function. -->

<p>Like most plotting commands, Sage commands that appear above have many options to configure how the plot is generated. You will learn about some
of these options from the examples in these modules and in class, but there
are more than we could discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. What do you notice about the contours in the contour plot of the shopping function?</p>
<h3 id="cross-sectional-functions"><a href="#cross-sectional-functions">Cross-sectional functions</a></h3>
<p>
  If you read along a horizontal or vertical line in the plane, you can get an idea of how changes in either of the inputs affect the output. Remember, for the functions of 2 variables we are looking at, <span class="math">x</span> and <span class="math">y</span> are both <em>independent</em> variables. Neither one is what you are used to thinking of as an &ldquo;output&rdquo;. Instead, the inputs are points in the plane (that is, $(x,y)$ pairs) and the outputs correspond to the labels or colors in the contour plot.
</p>
<p>So what does it mean to &ldquo;read along a horizontal line&rdquo;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Choose a horizontal line in the $(x,y)$-plane.
What is its equation? What happens to the values of the shopping function
as you move from left to right along this line? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Formulate and complete a similar exercise
about a vertical line. Which direction will you &ldquo;walk&rdquo; along
it?</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="surfaces-and-graphs"><a href="#surfaces-and-graphs">Surfaces and graphs</a></h3>
<p>Returning to the abstract geometry of $\mathbf{R}^3$, it is time to consider the meaning of equations among the three variables <span class="math">x</span>, <span class="math">y</span>, and <span class="math">z</span>.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that most equations are neither “true” or “false” without further context. For example, the equation <span class="math">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</span> might be, for certain <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">b</span>, or <span class="math">c</span>, either true or false. Because of this, it lacks a truth-value without such context. The equations we graph in calculus are similar. It is just this vagueness that allows us to use equations to describe curves in the plane.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An equation involving <span class="math">x</span> and <span class="math">y</span>, but no other variables, describes a curve in the plane <span class="math">\mathbf{R}^2</span>. A point of the plane is said to <em>lie on</em> this curve when its coordinates, when substituted in the curve’s equation, yield truth. In this case, the pair <span class="math">(x,y)</span> is said to <em>be a solution</em> of the equation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as above, an equation involving <span class="math">x</span>, <span class="math">y</span>, and <span class="math">z</span>, but no other variables, describes a surface in <span class="math">\mathbf{R}^3</span>. A particular point lies on the surface precisely when its coordinates are a solution of the equation.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../Workshops/00/Workshop.pdf">Workshop 00</a>, you developed the ideas necessary to find formulas giving the distance between any pair of points in <span class="math">\mathbf{R}^3</span> as well as the distance from any point to a coordinate plane or axis. These formulas suffice to construct all spheres, circular cylinders, and circular cones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. Give formulas for the distance from an arbitrary point <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> to each of the six  coordinate planes and axes. Can you think of a mnemonic trick to remember which is which?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recall also from <a href="../../Workshops/00/Workshop.pdf">Workshop 00</a> that it is often very convenient to deal with <em>squares</em> of distances, rather than distances themselves.</p>
<p>The simplest curved surface to describe is a sphere. A sphere is easily described in terms of distance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>sphere</em> is a closed surface whose interior has a special point, called the <em>center</em>, such that all the segments connecting the center with points of the sphere are equal in length. This length is called the <em>radius</em> of the sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition implies that, for any point <span class="math">(a,b,c)</span> and any radius <span class="math">r \geq 0</span>, there is a unique sphere with center <span class="math">(a,b,c)</span> and radius<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> <span class="math">r</span>. If <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> is a point on the sphere, the distance from it to the center must be <span class="math">r</span>, and this observation yields the classical equation describing the coordinates of points on the sphere.</p>
<p><span class="math">(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2</span></p>
<p>As before, working with squares of distances minimizes how much we must put up with unpleasant square roots.</p>
<p>The other surfaces which concern us at present—the cones and the circular cylinders—are also obtained by the equating of various distances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>circular cylinder</em> is a surface whose interior has a special line, called the <em>axis</em> of the cylinder, such that all points on the surface have the same distance to the axis. To nobody’s surprise, this length is called the <em>radius</em> of the cylinder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best, most special lines in the plane are, of course, the coordinate axes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the definition above and the formulas from <a href="../../Workshops/00/Workshop.pdf">Workshop 00</a> to write down an equation for the coordinates of points on a cylinder of radius <span class="math">r</span> whose axis is the <span class="math">z</span>-axis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last class of surfaces we will discuss here is the circular cones<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>circular cone with aperture <span class="math">\pi/2 = \tau/4</span></em> is a surface characterized by a line, called the <em>axis</em> of the cone, and a plane perpendicular to the axis. Points on the cone are equidistant from the axis and the plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with cylinders, it is possible to find equations for arbitrary cones: those whose axes and perpendicular planes are completely random. But in general, it is not so useful to do so. It would be smarter to choose coordinates in a clever way, so that it is not even necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the definition above and the formulas from <a href="../../Workshops/00/Workshop.pdf">Workshop 00</a> to write down an equation for the coordinates of points on a circular cone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="slicing-graphs"><a href="#slicing-graphs">Slicing graphs</a></h3>
<p>The idea of “slicing graphs” is one that is probably familiar to you, but with disguised terminology.</p>
<h4 id="the-vertical-line-test-revisited"><a href="#the-vertical-line-test-revisited">The “vertical line test” revisited</a></h4>
<p>“The vertical line test” is a criterion used to decide whether a plane curve is the graph of a function (of the horizontal coordinate). To employ it, you visualize all the vertical lines in the plane. Each of these gives a “slice” of the curve—the intersection of the vertical line with the curve. The vertical line test says that the curve is the graph of a function if, and only if, no slice has more than one point in it.</p>
<p>As soon as you find a slice with two (or more) points in it, then you know the curve is not the graph of any function of the horizontal coordinate.</p>
<p>Slicing curves in the plane is not so interesting, because most of the time the slices are boring: a handful of points, possibly empty. Think of the vertical lines as the knives doing the slicing. In the cases of interest to us, the knives won’t necessarily be lines. Instead, they will be planes.</p>
<p>The knives don’t have to be vertical for slicing to make sense. It would be possible to talk about the slice obtained by intersecting the curve with any line, of any slope.</p>
<h4 id="slicing-in-3-dimensions"><a href="#slicing-in-3-dimensions">Slicing in 3 dimensions</a></h4>
<p>3 dimensions is one up from 2, and <em>surfaces</em> are one up from <em>curves</em>. So what does it mean to slice a surface? We have to say what the knife is. Usually, it will be some plane. The <em>slice</em> we get is the intersection of that plane with the surface—usually, a handful of curves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. What are the slices that can result from slicing a sphere? Make sure you include all the possibilities for what the intersection looks like.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. What does the slice of a circular cylinder look like if the slicing plane is perpendicular to the cylinder? If it is parallel? If it is neither? What can you say about the shapes that are so obtained?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-vertical-line-test-for-2-variable-functions"><a href="#the-vertical-line-test-for-2-variable-functions">The vertical line test for 2-variable functions</a></h4>
<p>Slicing can be used to determine whether a particular surface is the graph of a function of the two horizontal coordinates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. Describe the knives used to slice for the 3-dimensional vertical line test.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. Formulate the vertical line test for 2-variable functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="coordinate-slices-and-level-curves"><a href="#coordinate-slices-and-level-curves">Coordinate slices and level curves</a></h4>
<p>The most important special case of slicing surfaces is when the knife is a plane parallel to one of the coordinate planes. The case of the plane <span class="math">z = 0</span> (that is, the <span class="math">(x,y)</span>-plane) merits special attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Definition</em>. If <span class="math">f(x,y)</span> is a 2-variable function, the slice of its graph obtained by slicing with the plane <span class="math">z = c</span> is called the level curve of <span class="math">f(x,y)</span> with level <span class="math">c</span>.</p>
