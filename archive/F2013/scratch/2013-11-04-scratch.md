\fullwidth{\subsection{A cylindrical coordinate system}

The cartesian coordinates on $\R^3$ are determined by the coordinate \emph{surfaces} $x = a$, $y = b$, and $z = c$. The \emph{cylindrical} coordinate system is so named because one family of coordinate surfaces are the cylinders (with axis the $z$-axis) $r = r_0$. 

The best way to describe the cylindrical coordinate system is to say it is polar coordinates for the $(x,y)$-plane together with the usual $z$-coordinate. The cylindrical coordinate transformation is the collection of equations
\begin{align*}
    x &= r \cos \theta \\
    y &= r \sin \theta \\
    z &= z.
\end{align*}

\question Let $R'$ be the region between the surface $2x^2 + 2z^2 = y$ and $y = 8$; it is congruent to $R$, but oriented differently in space. Construct a coordinate system (similar to cylindrical as described above) that is appropriate to describe this region, and describe it. \emph{Hint.} Choose the ``polar'' part of the coordinates to go with the rotational symmetry of $R'$.
