## Scientific computing in R and R Studio

Topics to discuss in introducing R and R Studio:

- getting started
    - directory structure 
    - get wd - try to get a file
    - change wd
    - list files 2 ways 
    - print 2 ways 
    - organize in a folder 
    - project management 
    - setwd
    - community support 
        - [Getting Help Video (Coursera)](http://youtu.be/ZFaWxxzouCY) -- how to ask for help effectively
        - StackOverflow
        - Other forums, mailing lists
        - Note that instructions dealing with local installations won't always apply directly to your situation
- R as a programming language
    - base package and associated packages
    - over 4000 user-developed packages at CRAN
    - frog-knows how many elsewheree
    - so, you import packages as you need them
        - including the MOSAIC package
        - which requires other packages
        - and so on.
- Interact with R via the console
    - you can treat it like a calculator
    - but with better facility for storing variables
    - since we use Enter to evaluate, free to use "=" for assignment
