This exam is closed book: you may refer to one double-sided page of handwritten notes, but no electronic aids or other
printed references are permitted. Justification of all answers is required
for partial credit unless otherwise noted; please \fbox{\textbf{box}} your final answers. Unless specifically directed, leave all answers in \textbf{exact form}, e.g.\ $\sqrt{3}$ instead of~$1.732$ and~$\pi/2$ instead of~$1.57$.

Show all pertinent work. \emph{Correct answers without accompanying work will receive little or no credit.} Results from class or from homework or from class can be cited freely. It is in your interest to display your solution in a
clear, readable fashion.

Do not write on the exam paper. Use your own paper, or the provided paper. \emph{Work on the exam paper itself will be disregarded.} 

Please submit problems in order. Leave a note if you get them out of order.

If you have a question, please raise your hand.

Be sure to read all questions carefully and completely.
