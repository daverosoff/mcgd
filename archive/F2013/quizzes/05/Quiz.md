\noindent
This quiz is \emph{open-note}, but no books or calculators may be used. In calculation, you can show work at your discretion, but remember that I can't give partial credit for calculations I can't see. Explain anything that seems to need explaining.

\begin{questions} 

\question If $z=(x+y)e^y$, $x=u^2+v^2$, and $y=u^2-v^2$, find the indicated partial derivatives using the chain rule. Express your answers in terms of $u$ and $v$.

\begin{parts}
    \part[4] $\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial u} = $

    \dwrspace{2}

    \part[4] $\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial v} = $

    \dwrspace{2}
\end{parts}

\question[8] Suppose that $z^7 = 11xe^{y/z}$. Calculate the indicated partial derivatives.

\begin{parts}
    \part[4] $\dfrac{\partial z}{\partial x} = $

    \dwrspace{2}

    \part[4] $\dfrac{\partial x}{\partial z} = $

    \dwrspace{1}
\end{parts}
