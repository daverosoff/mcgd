# Our Context: \(\R^3\)

This module introduces the geometry of the three-dimensional 

* relationship between coordinates and distances to hyperplanes
* relationship between coordinates and distances to points
* spheres, cylinders, and cones
* contour maps and cross-sectional functions
* modeling with linear 2-variable functions
* intersections of surfaces
* detect whether two vectors in \(R^3\) are parallel
* displacement vectors as differences of positions
* graphical depiction of linear relations among vectors
