# Evaluating double integrals

## WeBWorK problem 14

A pile of earth standing on flat ground has height $36$ meters. The ground is the $(x,y)$-plane. The origin is directly below the top of the pile and the $z$-axis is upward. The cross-section at height $z$ is given by $x^2+y^2=36-z$ for $0 \leq z \leq 36$, with $x$, $y$, and $z$ in meters.
